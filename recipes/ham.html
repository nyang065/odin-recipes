        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup pineapple juice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 large orange</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon grounded cloves</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, and 1/3 cup honey in a saucepan. Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in the juice. Add Dijon mustard and ground cloves; whisk mixture over medium-high heat as it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until glaze thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste glaze and adjust seasonings. Add lemon juice for more tang, or honey to make it sweeter. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove ham from the oven after it has baked for 2 hours. Brush with glaze. Bake for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, brushing ham with glaze every 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
